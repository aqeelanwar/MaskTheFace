## What is MaskTheFace?
MaskTheFace is computer vision-based script to mask faces in images. It uses a dlib based face landmarks detector to identify the face tilt and six key features of the face necessary for applying mask. Based on the face tilt, corresponding mask template is selected from the library of mask. The template mask is then transformed based on the six key features to fit perfectly on the face. The complete block diagram can be seen below. MaskTheFace provides a number of masks to select from. It is difficult to collect mask dataset under various conditions. MaskTheFace can be used to convert any existing face dataset to masked-face dataset. MaskTheFace identifies all the faces within an image, and applies the user selected masks to them taking into account various limitations such as face angle, mask fit, lighting conditions etc. A single image, or entire directory of images can be used as input to code.

|    mask_type   | Select the mask to be applied. Available options are 'N95', 'surgical_blue', 'surgical_green', 'cloth', 'empty' and 'inpaint'. The details of these mask types can be seen in the image above. More masks will be added |
|     pattern    |                                 Selects the pattern to be applied to the mask-type selected above. The textures are available in the masks/textures folder. User can add more textures.                                 |
| pattern_weight |                                   Selects the intensity of the pattern to be applied on the mask. The value should be between 0 (no texture strength) to 1 (maximum texture strength)                                   |
|      color     |                                                         Selects the color to be applied to the mask-type selected above. The colors are provided as hex values.                                                         |
|  color_weight  |                                      Selects the intensity of the color to be applied on the mask. The value should be between 0 (no color strength) to 1 (maximum color strength)                                      |
|      code      |                                                              Can be used to create specific mask formats at random. More can be found in the section below.                                                             |

|write_original_image|                   If used, the original unmasked image will also be saved in the masked image folder along with processed masked image                                                                              |

### Explanation:
#### 1. _--code_
The --code argument can be used to apply different type of masks uniformly at random to the images in the dataset.
```
# Generic format
--code < masktype1 >-< color as hex or texture file path >, < masktype2 >-< color as hex or texture file path>, ...

# Example
--code cloth-masks/textures/check/check_4.jpg, cloth-#e54294, cloth-#ff0000, cloth, cloth-masks/textures/others/heart_1.png, cloth-masks/textures/fruits/pineapple.png, N95
```
The example above will apply 7 different masks, uniform at random, to the selected face dataset (via --path argument).

# MFR2 - Masked Faces in Real-World for Face Recognition
Masked faces in real world for face recognition (MFR2) is a small dataset with 53 identities of celebrities and politicians with a total of 269 images that are collected from the internet. Each identity has on an average of 5 images. The dataset contains both masked and unmasked faces of the identities.
The dataset is processed in terms of face alignment and image dimensions. Each image has a dimension of (160x160x3). Sample images from the MFR2 data-set and the mask distribution can be seen below.
